    <b>gpt-code-search</b> is an AI-based tool enabling you to search your codebase using natural language. It employs Language Models (LLMs) and vector embeddings‚Äîa technique to convert objects, like text, into vectors‚Äîto retrieve, search, and answer queries about your code, boosting productivity and code understanding.

## Features

- **LLM-based Search & Retrieval**: Uses Language Models for efficient code search, retrieval, and comprehension.
- **File-system Integration**: Designed to work with any codebase and operates directly with any local code on your machine, allowing seamless integration with your existing workflow.
- **Language Agnostic**: Supports multiple programming languages.
- **Privacy-centric Design**: Code snippets are only transmitted when a question is asked and the Language Model requests the relevant code, ensuring privacy. **(Note: Code snippets are shared with OpenAI)**

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pip install gpt-code-search
```

### Usage

#### Create a project

First, create a project to index all the files. This step involves creating embeddings for each file and storing them in a local database.

```bash
gpt-code-search create-project <project-name> <path-to-codebase>

gpt-code-search create-project gpt-code-search .
```

#### Ask a question about your codebase

To query about the purpose of your codebase, you can use the `query` command:

```bash
gpt-code-search query <project-name> "What does this codebase do?"
```

If you want to generate a test for a specific file, for example analytics.py, you can mention the file name to improve accuracy:

```bash
gpt-code-search query gpt-code-search "Can you generate a test for analytics.py?"
```

For a general usage question about a certain module, like analytics, you can use keywords to search across the codebase:

```bash
gpt-code-search query gpt-code-search "How do I use the analytics module?"
```

**Remember, mentioning the file name or specific keywords improves the accuracy of the search.**

#### List all projects

To get a list of all the projects:

```bash
gpt-code-search list-projects
```

#### Refresh a project

If you want to reindex a project and update the embeddings to the latest content:

```bash
gpt-code-search refresh-project <project-name>
```

#### Delete a project

If you wish to delete a project and all its data (including embeddings):

```bash
gpt-code-search delete-project <project-name>
```

#### Select a model to use

You can select which model to use for your queries:

```bash
gpt-code-search select-model
```

Defaults to `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k`. The selected model is stored in `$HOME/.gpt-code-search/config.toml`.

### Configuration

The tool will prompt you to configure the `OPENAI_API_KEY`, if you haven't already.

## Problem

You want to leverage the power of GPT-4 to search your codebase, but you don't want to manually copy and paste code snippets into a prompt nor send your code to another third-party service (other than OpenAI). This tool solves these problems by letting GPT-4 determine the most relevant code snippets within your codebase. It also allows you to perform your queries in your terminal, removing the need for a separate UI.

Examples of the types of questions you might want to ask:

- üêõ Help debugging errors and finding the relevant code and files
- üìù Document large files or functionalities formatted as markdown
- üõ†Ô∏è Generate new code based on existing files and conventions
- üì® Ask general questions about any part of the codebase

## Roadmap

- [x] Use vector embeddings to improve search and retrieval
- [ ] Add support for generating code and saving it to a file
- [ ] Support for searching across multiple codebases
- [ ] Allow the model to create new functions that it can then execute
- [ ] Use [guidance](https://github.com/microsoft/guidance) to improve prompts
- [ ] Add support for additional models (Claude, Bedrock, etc)
