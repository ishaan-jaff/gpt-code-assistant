## Features

- 🧠 **GPT-4**: code search, retrieval, and answering all done with OpenAI.
- 🔐 **Privacy-first**: code snippets only leave your machine when you ask a question and the LLM requests the relevant code.
- 🔥 **Works instantly**: no pre-processing, chunking, or indexing, get started right away.
- 📦 **File-system backed**: works with any code on your machine.

## Privacy

Outside of the LLM, no data is sent or stored.

The only data sent to LLM is the question you ask and the code snippets that is requests related to your question. All code snippets are retrieved from your local machine.
